# RetroInfer

[RetroInfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02922) is a novel system that **rethinks the KV cache as vector storage** within a GPU–CPU co-execution setup to accelerate long-context LLM inference. It exploits the inherent sparsity of the attention mechanism and introduces an **A**ttention-a**W**are **VE**ctor index (*wave index*) that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens from the KV cache. Complementing this is the *wave buffer*, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup
The required dependency packages rely on `CUDA 12.4`, you can use the docker image `nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu22.04` if your system does not have CUDA 12.4 installed.

The code was tested with `Python 3.10.16`, we recommend using `conda` to mange your Python environments:
```bash
# firstly install miniconda if you don't have it, then create a new conda environment:
conda create -n retroinfer python=3.10 -y
conda activate retroinfer 

# install conda packages
conda install -y mkl
conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng -y

# may need to downgrade pip to <=25.0 to solve `DEPRECATION warning` when using `pip install .` to install kernels
python -m pip install pip==25.0

# install python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn==2.6.3 --no-build-isolation
pip install flashinfer-python==0.2.4 -i https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu124/torch2.4/
pip install git+https://github.com/Starmys/flash-attention.git@weighted
```

### Install RetroInfer Kernels
```bash
cd library/
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass.git
cd retroinfer && pip install . && cd ../../
```

### Simple Test
We provide a simple demo to verify that the environment is set up correctly. The demo runs on four different contexts from [RULER](https://github.com/NVIDIA/RULER), each containing approximately 120,000 tokens. You can run the demo using the following command:
```bash
python -u simple_test.py --batch_size 4
```
Running this demo requires about 25GB GPU memory and 67GB CPU memory. If you encounter out-of-memory errors, consider reducing the batch size.

You can also customize the input contexts by providing a `json` file in the following format:
```
[
    {"input": str, "outputs": str}, 
    {"input": str, "outputs": str},
    ...
]
``` 
Then, pass the file path using the `--data_path` argument:
```bash
python -u simple_test.py --data_path <your_json_file_path>
```

## Run Benchmark

You may need to set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` before running the benchmark since our code will automatically split models into all visable GPUs. For example, when evaluating with A100 80GB, 7B/8B models only need one GPU card while 72B models need at least 3 GPU cards. 

### [RULER](https://github.com/NVIDIA/RULER)
To evaluate the model accuracy on the RULER benchmark, you need firstly download the benchmark datasets:
```bash
cd benchmark/ruler
cd data/synthetic/json/ && python -u download_paulgraham_essay.py && bash download_qa_dataset.sh && cd ../../../
```
Then, you can run [ruler_run.sh](benchmark/ruler/ruler_run.sh) to evaluate.
For example, you can evaluate `RetroInfer` on RULER variable tracing task `vt` with the context length of `128K` using the following command:
```bash
bash ruler_run.sh llama-3-8b-1048k synthetic RetroInfer 131072 vt bf16 0.018 0.232
```
The input parameters of the evaluation script are, in order:
- `model name`: supported models include `llama-3.1-8b`, `llama-3-8b-1048k`, `qwen2.5-7b` and `qwen2.5-72b`;
- `benchmark name`: set to `synthetic`;
- `attention type`: `RetroInfer` or `Full_Flash_Attn`;
- `input context length`: the input context length;
- `evaluate task name`: supported tasks include `niah_single_1`, `niah_single_2`, `niah_single_3`, `niah_multikey_1`, `niah_multikey_2`, `niah_multikey_3`, `niah_multivalue`, `niah_multiquery`, `vt`, `cwe`, `fwe`, `qa_1` and `qa_2`;
- `model data type`: supported data types include `bf16` and `fp16`;
- `retrieval budget ratio`: the ratio of the number of tokens to be retrieved from the KV cache to the total number of tokens in the input context;
- `attention estimate ratio`: the ratio of the number of clusters to be estimated in the attention mechanism to the total number of clusters.

### [LongBench](https://github.com/THUDM/LongBench)
You can use the following command to evaluate the model accuracy of `RetroInfer` on the LongBench:
```bash
cd benchmark/LongBench
bash longbench_run.sh llama-3-8b-1048k RetroInfer 0.018 0.232 bf16
```
The input parameters of the evaluation script are, in order:
- `model name`: supported models include `llama-3.1-8b`, `llama-3-8b-1048k`, `qwen2.5-7b` and `qwen2.5-72b`;
- `attention type`: `RetroInfer` or `Full_Flash_Attn`;
- `retrieval budget ratio`: the ratio of the number of tokens to be retrieved from the KV cache to the total number of tokens in the input context;
- `attention estimate ratio`: the ratio of the number of clusters to be estimated in the attention mechanism to the total number of clusters;
- `model data type`: supported data types include `bf16` and `fp16`.

## Reproduce Throughput Results
We provide scripts to reproduce the throughput results reported in the paper. These experiments were conducted on an [Azure virtual machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/ndma100v4-series?tabs=sizebasic) featuring 4 NUMA nodes. Each NUMA node is equipped with 24 CPU cores, 475 GB of CPU memory, and two 80GB A100 GPUs.
```bash
# Firstly, install the numactl package
sudo apt install numactl -y

# run scripts
cd throughput_eval
bash run.sh
```
